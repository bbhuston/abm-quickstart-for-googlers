# Provisioning an Anthos bare metal environment on GCP

Googlers have the ability to provision self-service Linux VMs called "CloudTop instances" which run on Google's internal infrastructure.  This guide walks Googlers through the process of using CloudTop to provision an Anthos bare metal environment inside of Google's internal `google.com` GCP Organization.  

##### Connecting to your CloudTop instance

First, ensure that you have a [CloudTop instance provisioned and powered on.](https://support.google.com/techstop/answer/2662330?hl=en&ref_topic=2683844)  Afterwards, you can connect to it and complete the rest of the ABM provisioning process.

```
# Generate a session token to connect to CloudTop
gcert

# Connect to your CloudTop instance
export CLOUDTOP_ALIAS=<This is usually your Google LDAP>
ssh ${CLOUDTOP_ALIAS}.c.googlers.com

# Generate another session token from inside CloudTop
gcert
```

Now you are ready to run the following commmands from inside your new CloudTop session.

##### Download quickstart repo
```
git clone https://github.com/bbhuston/abm-quickstart-for-googlers.git
cd abm-quickstart-for-googlers
```

##### Set your GCP Project settings
```
PROJECT_ID=<Enter your Anthos bare metal GCP Project ID>
USER_EMAIL=<Enter the email address associated with your GCP project (e.g., benhuston@google.com)>

make persist-settings -e PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID} -e USER_EMAIL=${USER_EMAIL}

```

##### Set default GCP Project
```
make set-default-gcp-project
```

##### Enable GCP APIs
```
make enable-gcp-apis
```

##### Configure IAM permissions
```
make configure-iam-permissions
```

##### Create VMs
```
make create-vms
```

##### Prepare an ABM hybrid cluster
```
make prepare-hybrid-cluster
```

##### Prepare an ABM user cluster that uses MetalLB
```
prepare-user-cluster-with-metallb
```

##### Prepare an ABM user cluster that uses GCE LoadBalancer
```
TODO
```

##### Configure Google Identity Login
```
export USER_EMAIL=<Enter the email address associated with your GCP project (e.g., benhuston@google.com)>
make install-google-identity-login
```
